## Overview

`WindowsNullDriverTesting` is a lightweight C++ utility that facilitates testing of a Windows null driver (`null.sys`). The tool demonstrates how to interact with the null driver, which is a minimal driver often used for testing kernel-mode interactions. This project is intended for **educational purposes** to study driver communication, kernel programming, or related Windows internals.

> **⚠️ Warning**: This tool is for educational and research purposes only. Unauthorized use on production systems or environments you do not have explicit permission to test is illegal and unethical.

---

## Features

- 🛠️ **Driver Interaction**: Sends IOCTL requests to the Windows null driver for testing purposes.
- 🔍 **Verbose Logging**: Outputs detailed information for debugging and analysis.
- ⚡ **Lightweight**: Minimal dependencies, easy to compile and run.
- 🧪 **Test-Oriented**: Ideal for learning about Windows kernel-driver interactions.

---

## Prerequisites

To build and run `WindowsNullDriverTesting`, ensure you have the following:

- **Operating System**: Windows (Tested on Windows 10/11)
- **Compiler**: MSVC (Visual Studio 2019 or later recommended)
- **Dependencies**: 
  - Windows Driver Kit (WDK) or Windows SDK (for kernel-related headers)
- **Null Driver**: Ensure `null.sys` is available on the system (typically included in Windows).

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TamatahYT/WindowsNullDriverTesting.git
   cd WindowsNullDriverTesting
   ```

2. **Build the Project**:
   Using MSVC:
   ```bash
   cl nullDriverTest.cpp /Fe:nullDriverTest.exe /link /SUBSYSTEM:CONSOLE
   ```

3. **Verify Build**:
   Confirm that the compiled binary (`nullDriverTest.exe`) is created in the project directory.

> **Note**: Ensure the Windows SDK or WDK is installed and properly configured in your build environment.

---

## Usage

1. **Run the Tool**:
   Open a Command Prompt with administrative privileges and execute:
   ```bash
   nullDriverTest.exe [options]
   ```

2. **Options**:
   ```
   -h, --help        Display help message
   -v, --verbose     Enable verbose output
   -t, --test        Run specific test case [e.g., IOCTL code]
   ```

3. **Example**:
   ```bash
   nullDriverTest.exe --verbose
   ```

4. **Expected Output**:
   ```
   [INFO] Initializing null driver test...
   [DEBUG] Opening handle to null.sys...
   [SUCCESS] IOCTL request completed successfully!
   ```

> **Note**: The actual options and output depend on the functionality implemented in `nullDriverTest.cpp`. Update this section with specific parameters if applicable.
